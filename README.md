# Colletotrichum sp. H109 Annotation     
   
## Abstract     
Apple Bitter Rot in New York orchards caused by opportunistic ascomycetes in the genus **Colletotrichum** lead to the significant loss of harvest both in storage and in the orchard. There is an increase in disease incidence and severity with increasing summer warm wetting events.  While species delimitation using morphology and culture methods remains insufficient for species-level resolution, multi-locus phylogenetic analyses support distinct clades within the **Colletotrichum genus**. Characteristic profiles of virulence, tolerance to fungicides, optimal temperatures for disease development, overwintering strategies and fruit infectivity are evident between and within clades, but the biological mechanisms underlying these differences are unknown.  Whole genome sequencing and functional annotation of **Colletotrichum** isolates originating from orchards in New York and Virginia, spanning the two major **Colletotrichum** clades, **Gloeosporioides** and **Acutatum**, are being conducted to resolve the taxonomic placement of those isolates most correlated with the incidence of Apple Bitter Rot. Here we report the assembly and annotation of **Colletotricum** species isolate H109, a sub-species of **C. fructicola** within the **Gloeosporioides** clade.
